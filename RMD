##R script called run_analysis.R

##I read about the project at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones then loaded R packages
using the lower left pane: data.table, dplyr, ggplot2, git2r, lubridate, magrittr, plyr, readr, readxl, stringr, tidyr, writeexl

##I downloaded the data set and saved it as HAR.zip from this website and read the ReadMe file

##I called in the pertinent Train and Test datasets by importing each separately using the import text function in the upper right pane. 
##I used this website as a guide: https://thoughtfulbloke.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/getting-and-cleaning-the-assignment/

##1. I merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Subject <- rbind(subject_train, subject_test)

X <- rbind(X_train, X_test)

Y <- rbind(y_train, y_test)

Data <- cbind(Subject, X, Y)

##2. Extracted the mean and sd for each measurement (Extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.)

XMean <- colMeans(X, na.rm = TRUE)

X_SD <- X %>% summarise_if(is.numeric, sd)

X <- rbind(XMean, X_SD)

YMean <- colMeans(Y, na.rm = TRUE)

Y_SD <- Y %>% summarise_if(is.numeric, sd)

Y <- rbind(YMean, Y_SD)

Data2 <- cbind(Subject, X_SD, Y_SD)

##3. I used Data2 the descriptive activity names in the features file to name the activities in the data set preserving anonymity by not including references to Subjects.

Data2 <- cbind(features, X_SD, Y_SD)

##4. I labeled Data2 with descriptive variable names – I choose Standard Deviation or “SD” and to keep the features nomenclature as it related to the original 
##datasets so researchers could find the information in the raw data, as necessary. I used this website: https://www.statology.org/how-to-rename-data-frame-columns-in-r/

names(Data2)[3-50] <- "SD"

names(Data2)[1] <- "Incident"

names(Data2)[2] <- "Features"

names(Data2)[47] <- "SD"

##From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
##I decided to not identify subjects, to preserve anonymity and to focus on the necessary data: SD, which is “Standard Deviation” for each activity. 
##Therefore, it is my argument that a tidy dataset should not contain Subject information to be more scientific. 
##I then saved my last dataset (Data5) as a text after installing writeexl and using the write.xlsx function. 
##Since I have a PC, I can use my Excel to save the data as a text and an .xls file I can manipulate later using Excel, if I choose.

Data3 <- cbind(activity_labels, X_SD, Y_SD)

Data4 <- colMeans(Data4[sapply(Data4, is.numeric)])

View(Data4)

Data4 <- Data3[, c("SD")]

Data5 <- cbind(activity_labels, Data4)

View(Data5)

names(Data5)[1] <- "Activity_No."

names(Data5)[2] <- "Activity"

names(Data5)[3] <- "SD"

installed.packages(writexl)

write_xlsx(Data5,"C:\Users\CA\Documents\Data6.xlsx")
